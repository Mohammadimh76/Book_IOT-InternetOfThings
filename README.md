# "IOT (Internet Of Things)"

---

## Introduction:
As the world of technology evolves, new areas are emerging, culminating in the digital age. The Internet of Things is emerging as one of the main trends shaping the development of technology in the field of information and communication technology, and the change in the use of the Internet to communicate between end-users to the Internet used to communicate between physical objects to a particular service Requires a rethinking of some traditional approaches to network management, computing, and service delivery.<br>
The book Basics of IoT, written by Seyed Yahya Moradi and Mohammad Hossein Mohammadi, intends to provide a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of IoT technology to guide readers to continue their education and work path.<br>
This book consists of six chapters in which an attempt has been made to explain all the topics of this technology comprehensively and fluently for those who are interested, students and university professors.<br>

Iam currently a Final-year BS.c student at the Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch (IAUN) (Rank in CWUR) where I am a member of the Bioinformatics Laboratory (BL), advised by Prof. Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi. my research involves machine vision, deep learning, and neural networks. where I will complete my thesis on Accurate and Early Identification of Diabetes and it's Affecting Factors.

Prior to BL, I finished my Diploma - Mathematics and Physics in Sheikh Ansari Highschool, in September 2015. I tried to use my Diploma to build a solid bedrock for my future research. So in addition to taking many optional bachelor-level courses on math and computer science. I spent 6 months as an intern Programmer at the "CoTech" in Isfahan.

#### My main research interests
- Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
- Optimization Algorithm, Neural & NeuroFuzzy Network
- Computer Vision, Signal and Image Processing
